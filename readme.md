## Robot simulator

Implementation of a coding challenge to simulate a robot on a table in ruby

### Improvements / TODOS

This is a list of things that I intend to do next until I feel I've spent enough time on this already

- test exception paths
- 

This is a list of things that I think would make sense to do but aren't in the spec

- have a method for the robot to report which table it is on.
