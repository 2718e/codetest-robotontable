command form was given as backticks with commands separated on lines

suggests the commands are essentiall string format.

Would make sense to separate the concerns of command parsing and execution

Specifies only that the application should read commands not that the robot should, so should be ok to have the
robot command set strictly defined by say type systems / enums (assuming ruby has these, been a while) - actually even
could have these be methods.
Probably make them methods.
extensibility point, make the table a parameter to the place method.

then can have adapters to parse commands from different sources (e.g. console, file, rest API, string)

for sake of this exercise probably only use one of them

looking up interfaces in ruby - seems to not have them but not needed due to duck typing, can either have a class thar wraps something
or extend a class that raises notimplemented when any method called.

Are these even necessary at all?

Apparently vectors can be used in hashes by value, this could be useful for representing directions

should orientation be specified as an enumerable or a vector?

Wait ruby doesnt seem to have enums - in which case is a symbol or a constant better? need to find out more about symbols

is a symbol keyed hash roughly equivalent to enum?

should direction symbols to vectors and turns from directions be in the same module or 2 separate modules
